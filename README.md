# gachchan: common funcs for both Serverside and Clientside

## Install

In your project (which you want to use `gachchan`), Specify `"gachchan": "github:lockevn/gachchan#v6.7.2"` in your project, which `v6.7.2` is the version (a tag on `gachchan` repo)

Then run `npm i gachchan`

### How we setup Deps

This lib `gachchan` use `_intersection from 'lodash/intersection'` to import function from `lodash`

- `_intersection` will not be bundled into `gachchan` by default. When you write `import \_intersection from 'lodash/intersection'`, it creates a dependency that expects `lodash` to be available at runtime.

- Specify `"peerDependencies":  {    "lodash": "^4.17.21"   }`â€‹ in `gachchan`.

  > You're using `lodash` but want to allow the consuming project to control the `lodash` version
  > It prevents multiple copies of `lodash` in the final application
  > It makes it clear to users of `gachchan` that they need to install `lodash`

- Do `tts-wallet` (which use `gachchan`) need to depend on `lodash`?

  - Yes, `tts-wallet` needs to install `lodash` as a direct dependency because:
  - It's a peer dependency of `gachchan`
    The import statements in `gachchan` expect to find `lodash` in `node_modules`
  - If `tts-wallet` doesn't install `lodash`, you'll get runtime errors about missing modules
