# gachchan (ALPHA)

Helper functions I found useful
Still in ALPHA mode, I'll contribute my (working) code to this lib with fully unit test (weekly).

## Project setup

This was built as a lib work for both NodeJS and Browser
using 1.3 in this https://dev.to/riversun/recipes-on-how-to-create-a-library-that-supports-both-browser-and-node-js-201m#(1-3)

Building JavaScript Library in ES6 using Webpack and Babel

3. Install dependencies using `npm i`
4. Run `npm run build`
5. A Bundled file `index will be generated in`dist/` directory.


## Publish npm via Github Packages

see https://windix.medium.com/host-and-publish-npm-package-on-github-bb419a2acfd3

> You cannot delete a public package yourself (similarly, npmjs only supports to delete a public package within 72 hours).


## Run

run `npm run test` to execute unit test

# Debug

See how https://gist.github.com/paambaati/54d33e409b4f7cf059cc

But I prefer run node test/index.js for easier
