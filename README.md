# gachchan common funcs for both Serverside and Clientside

## Install

In your project (which you want to use `gachchan`), Specify `"gachchan": "github:lockevn/gachchan#v6.7.2"` in your project, which `v6.7.2` is the version (a tag on `gachchan` repo)

Then run

```bash
npm i gachchan
```

### How we setup Deps

We use `_intersection from 'lodash/intersection'` to import function from lodash

- `_intersection` will not be bundled into gachchan by default. When you use import \_intersection from 'lodash/intersection', it creates a dependency that expects lodash to be available at runtime.

- Yes, specify `"peerDependencies":  {    "lodash": "^4.17.21"   }`â€‹ in `gachchan`.

You're using lodash but want to allow the consuming project to control the lodash version
It prevents multiple copies of lodash in the final application
It makes it clear to users of gachchan that they need to install lodash

- Do `tts-wallet` (which use `gachchan`) need to depend on lodash?

Yes, tts-wallet needs to install lodash as a direct dependency because:

- It's a peer dependency of gachchan
  The import statements in gachchan expect to find lodash in node_modules
- If tts-wallet doesn't install lodash, you'll get runtime errors about missing modules
  Here's how you should set up your package.json files:
